## 🏢 About the Company

**AtliQ Hardwares** is a leading hardware manufacturer in India with a growing global presence. However, their management team struggles to make fast and informed decisions due to a lack of actionable insights. As part of a hiring challenge, I was tasked to step into the role of a **junior data analyst** and deliver data-backed answers to 10 key business questions.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Analyze raw SQL tables and deliver actionable insights.
- Answer 10 ad-hoc business requests using SQL queries.
- Present insights in a way that’s clear to top-level executives.
- Showcase both technical (SQL) and communication (presentation) skills.

## 🗂️ Database Structure

The dataset includes 6 core tables:

1. `dim_customer` - Customer information including market, channel, and region.
2. `dim_product` - Product metadata like segment, category, and variant.
3. `fact_gross_price` - Gross product prices by fiscal year.
4. `fact_manufacturing_cost` - Manufacturing costs by fiscal year.
5. `fact_pre_invoice_deductions` - Discounts applied before invoicing.
6. `fact_sales_monthly` - Monthly sales transactions per product and customer.
